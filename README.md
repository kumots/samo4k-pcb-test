# Pagsamo - Noun in Tagalog, something one yearns for, or pleas for.
I have no idea how this is related to the project, but it just sounds cool.

Anyways, this is just a simple 2x2 keypad that you can order and assemble yourself to practice your skills in soldering and electronic work overall.
You can download the ZIP file containing all the gerber files and upload it to JLCPCB or any other platform that offers PCB printing services. You can also
refer to the attatched schematics and PCB KiCad files for further details.

This keypad is powered with a Mini-USB slot for simplicity, and also does not come with hotswap sockets, unfortunately(I don't know how to add them lmao).
